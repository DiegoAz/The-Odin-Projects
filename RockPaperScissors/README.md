# Game: Rock Paper Scissors

See [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) the assignment instructions

## To Do

- Create a blank HTML document with a script tag
- Write a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'
- Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
- Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end. At this point you should be using `console.log()` to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
- Use prompt() to get input from the user
